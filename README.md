A reinforcement learning model for stock market trading that implements multiple RL algorithms (PPO, A2C, DDPG, TD3, SAC) to optimize trading strategies using historical stock data. The project compares algorithm performance across different market conditions, includes custom reward functions accounting for risk-adjusted returns.
